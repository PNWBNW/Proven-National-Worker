# Proven Non-Citizen Workers (PNW) Whitepaper  

## Abstract  
The **Proven Non-Citizen Workers (PNW) smart contract** is a decentralized system designed to facilitate **fair employment, payroll automation, and compliance tracking** for migrant workers. By leveraging blockchain technology, PNW ensures transparency, efficiency, and worker protections while integrating with government systems for tax and labor law enforcement.

## 1. Introduction  

### 1.1 Problem Statement  
Migrant workers face challenges such as:  
- **Wage theft & delayed payments**  
- **Lack of legal protection & compliance oversight**  
- **Employer tax evasion & unreported labor**  
- **Limited financial access due to status restrictions**  

### 1.2 Proposed Solution  
The PNW smart contract offers a **trustless, transparent, and automated employment system** that:  
- Uses **blockchain payroll processing** to guarantee timely payments.  
- Requires **prepaid employer funds** to prevent wage theft.  
- Integrates **on-chain compliance tracking** to enforce tax laws.  
- Supports **worker-controlled identity verification** via NFTs & ZPass.

## 2. System Architecture  

### 2.1 Smart Contract Components  
The PNW ecosystem consists of:  
1. **Worker Identity Module** – Stores verified worker profiles on-chain.  
2. **Payroll & Compliance Module** – Manages wages, tax deductions, and compliance enforcement.  
3. **SubDAO Governance Module** – Enables decentralized decision-making for employer penalties & fund allocation.  
4. **Government API Module** – Automates tax compliance verification with labor offices.  

### 2.2 On-Chain Payroll Processing  
Employers **preload funds** into the system before hiring workers.  
When payroll is processed:  
- **Workers receive wages** after compliance verification.  
- **State/Country taxes** are deducted and paid automatically.  
- **SubDAO votes on employer penalties** for non-compliance.  

---

## 3. Compliance & Enforcement  

### 3.1 Employer Obligations  
Employers must:  
- Prepay wages & taxes before hiring workers.  
- Adhere to local labor laws enforced by **government API verification**.  
- Maintain tax compliance or face **tiered penalties & potential blacklisting**.  

### 3.2 Worker Protections  
- **Workers can report employer violations** directly on-chain.  
- **ZPass integration** (optional) enhances payroll security & verification.  
- **SubDAOs vote on wage adjustments** and worker protections.  

### 3.3 Automated Tax Payments  
- SubDAOs **automatically remit** employer payroll taxes to the appropriate state/country entity.  
- Employers **must maintain tax compliance** or face increasing fines.  
- Chronic offenders **are blacklisted** but can appeal through a **fine + 25% penalty**, with another **25% going to SubDAO worker funds**.  

---

## 4. Governance & Worker Voting  

### 4.1 Decentralized SubDAO Model  
Each SubDAO manages up to **100,000 workers** and:  
- Votes on employer penalties & reinstatement.  
- Oversees **worker wage negotiations**.  
- Manages **worker welfare funds** for legal aid, medical expenses, etc.  

### 4.2 Employer Penalty System  
- **1st violation** → Warning + tax compliance alert.  
- **2nd violation** → Fine equal to unpaid taxes + 25% penalty.  
- **3rd violation** → Employer blacklisted (must pay fine + 50% for reinstatement).

## 5. Technical Implementation  

### 5.1 Blockchain & Smart Contract Details  
- Written in **Leo** for privacy-preserving transactions.  
- Uses **ZKPs** for worker identity protection & government compliance verification.  
- Supports **batch payroll processing** to reduce gas fees.  

### 5.2 Interoperability & Bridging  
- **Supports EVM chains** for employer payroll & withdrawals.  
- Workers can choose **Aleo-native USDC or bridged USDC** for payments.  
- **Rollup batching every 30 minutes** for cost efficiency.  

---

## 6. Security & Privacy  

### 6.1 Worker Data Protection  
- Workers control **their own identity verification** (ZPass optional).  
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** prevent unauthorized data leaks.  

### 6.2 Fraud Prevention  
- Employers must prepay **before hiring** to prevent wage theft.  
- On-chain compliance records **prevent tax evasion**.  
- SubDAOs vote on **employer penalties & reinstatement**.  

---

## 7. Conclusion  
The PNW smart contract creates a **transparent, fair, and secure** employment system for non-citizen workers. By automating payroll, tax compliance, and governance, it **empowers workers** while ensuring **employers follow legal obligations**.  

### **Next Steps**  
- Employers should integrate **PNW payroll APIs**.  
- Governments should **connect compliance APIs** to track tax payments.  
- Workers can choose **ZPass verification** for added benefits.
