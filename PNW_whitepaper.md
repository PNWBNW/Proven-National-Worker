Version: 1.2

1. Introduction

The Proven National Workers (PNW) System is a decentralized workforce and payroll network designed to enhance labor compliance, financial transparency, and secure employment verification while protecting workers and employers through on-chain automation, identity verification, and governance mechanisms.

PNW does not replace or override existing government systems. Instead, it acts as a digital compliance layer, ensuring that employment records, payroll processing, and workforce protections are recorded, auditable, and enforceable on-chain. Through automated verification mechanisms, structured wage distribution, and compliance tracking, PNW fosters a more accountable, efficient, and corruption-resistant labor ecosystem.

2. Purpose & Design Philosophy

The PNW Smart Contract System is designed as a compliance enhancement tool that strengthens workforce operations while remaining aligned with legal and financial standards.

It operates with the following key objectives:

✅ Workforce Oversight – Verifiable on-chain employment agreements, payroll records, and tax contributions ensure compliance.
✅ Automated Verification – Workers are validated without replacing government verification systems, preserving national workforce integrity.
✅ Payroll Stability – Pre-funded wages and tax compliance enforcement ensure that workers receive payments securely and on time.
✅ Decentralized Governance – Both workers and employers participate in transparent, rule-based decision-making.

By leveraging Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and smart contracts, PNW ensures workforce compliance without requiring trust in third-party institutions.

3. Core Functionalities

The PNW system operates through automated smart contracts that enforce financial and workforce compliance without reliance on intermediaries.

3.1 Identity & Employment Verification

🔹 Workers provide on-chain attestations of employment status.
🔹 Employers verify worker eligibility using government databases via API requests (government data remains government-controlled).
🔹 Verified workers receive cryptographic proof of employment, granting them payroll and governance rights.

✅ Key Clarification: PNW does not modify, replace, or store government workforce data. It only requests API-based verification, ensuring all employment is legally authorized.

3.2 Financial Accountability & Payroll Enforcement

💰 Escrowed payroll contracts require employers to pre-fund wages before work begins.
💳 Automated tax deductions ensure proper allocation at the time of payroll processing.
🔎 On-chain audits prevent payroll manipulation, ensuring every financial transaction is recorded and traceable.

By enforcing full pre-funding of wages, PNW eliminates wage theft, payroll fraud, and tax evasion risks.

3.3 Workforce Protections & Governance

🗳 Workers and employers participate in SubDAO governance, ensuring fair decision-making.
🚨 Workers can report violations on-chain, providing immutable complaint tracking.
📊 Employer compliance records prevent repeat labor violations while ensuring regulatory adherence.

✅ Key Advantage: PNW empowers workers and employers to govern their own workforce conditions, eliminating centralized bureaucratic inefficiencies.

3.4 Compliance Tracking & Government API Requests

📜 Employers submitting payroll must meet predefined tax compliance thresholds before payouts occur.
🔎 API requests verify tax payments, validate business legitimacy, and confirm work eligibility.
🔒 Government agencies retain full control of their own data, with PNW acting as a request-based compliance enforcer.

✅ Key Clarification: PNW does not interfere with government employment decisions. It merely facilitates structured, automated verification, reducing compliance burdens for workers and employers.

5. Integration with Noir & Aleo: Enhanced Privacy & Security

PNW utilizes Noir & Aleo for privacy-preserving compliance and payroll processing, ensuring that sensitive employment data remains secure while still being verifiable.

5.1 Zero-Knowledge Payroll Processing

🔹 Workers receive ZK-signed payroll proofs, allowing verification without revealing private salary details.
🔹 Payroll rollups minimize gas fees, reducing costs for employers and workers.

5.2 Aleo’s Private Smart Contracts for Worker Protection

🔒 Employers cannot modify records once submitted, preventing wage theft and contract fraud.
🔎 Compliance verifications occur on-chain but remain private, ensuring legal and financial confidentiality.

By eliminating third-party intermediaries and relying on Noir & Aleo, PNW ensures secure, verifiable, and trustless workforce management.

6. Expansion Roadmap: PNW's Vision for Workforce Decentralization

Phase 1: 🏗 Core Deployment – Smart contract deployment for payroll, worker verification, and tax compliance.
Phase 2: 🔄 Interoperability – Expansion to Noir-based compliance and cross-chain payroll bridging (Aleo → Noir/Stellar).
Phase 3: 🌍 Global Adoption – Expansion beyond national labor markets into cross-border workforce automation.
Phase 4: 🔐 Fully Private Workforce Management – Enabling zero-knowledge-based employer compliance verification.

PNW is not just a payroll network – it is a self-sustaining workforce ecosystem that aligns decentralization, compliance, and economic fairness.
