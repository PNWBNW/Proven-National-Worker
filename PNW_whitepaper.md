A Decentralized Workforce & Payroll Network for Compliance, Transparency, and Financial Security

Date: February 2025
Version: 1.2

1. Introduction

The Proven National Workers (PNW) System is a decentralized workforce and payroll network designed to enhance labor compliance, financial transparency, and secure employment verification while protecting workers and employers through on-chain automation, identity verification, and governance mechanisms.

PNW does not replace or override existing government systems. Instead, it acts as a digital compliance layer, ensuring that employment records, payroll processing, and workforce protections are recorded, auditable, and enforceable on-chain. Through automated verification mechanisms, structured wage distribution, and compliance tracking, PNW fosters a more accountable, efficient, and corruption-resistant labor ecosystem.

2. Purpose & Design Philosophy

The PNW Smart Contract System is designed as a compliance enhancement tool that strengthens workforce operations while remaining aligned with legal and financial standards.

It operates with the following key objectives:

✅ Workforce Oversight – Verifiable on-chain employment agreements, payroll records, and tax contributions ensure compliance.
✅ Automated Verification – Workers are validated without replacing government verification systems, preserving national workforce integrity.
✅ Payroll Stability – Pre-funded wages and tax compliance enforcement ensure that workers receive payments securely and on time.
✅ Decentralized Governance – Both workers and employers participate in transparent, rule-based decision-making.

By leveraging Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and smart contracts, PNW ensures workforce compliance without requiring trust in third-party institutions.

3. Core Functionalities

The PNW system operates through automated smart contracts that enforce financial and workforce compliance without reliance on intermediaries.

3.1 Identity & Employment Verification

🔹 Workers provide on-chain attestations of employment status.
🔹 Employers verify worker eligibility using government databases via API requests (government data remains government-controlled).
🔹 Verified workers receive cryptographic proof of employment, granting them payroll and governance rights.

✅ Key Clarification: PNW does not modify, replace, or store government workforce data. It only requests API-based verification, ensuring all employment is legally authorized.

3.2 Financial Accountability & Payroll Enforcement

💰 Escrowed payroll contracts require employers to pre-fund wages before work begins.
💳 Automated tax deductions ensure proper allocation at the time of payroll processing.
🔎 On-chain audits prevent payroll manipulation, ensuring every financial transaction is recorded and traceable.

By enforcing full pre-funding of wages, PNW eliminates wage theft, payroll fraud, and tax evasion risks.

3.3 Workforce Protections & Governance

🗳 Workers and employers participate in SubDAO governance, ensuring fair decision-making.
🚨 Workers can report violations on-chain, providing immutable complaint tracking.
📊 Employer compliance records prevent repeat labor violations while ensuring regulatory adherence.

✅ Key Advantage: PNW empowers workers and employers to govern their own workforce conditions, eliminating centralized bureaucratic inefficiencies.

3.4 Compliance Tracking & Government API Requests

📜 Employers submitting payroll must meet predefined tax compliance thresholds before payouts occur.
🔎 API requests verify tax payments, validate business legitimacy, and confirm work eligibility.
🔒 Government agencies retain full control of their own data, with PNW acting as a request-based compliance enforcer.

✅ Key Clarification: PNW does not interfere with government employment decisions. It merely facilitates structured, automated verification, reducing compliance burdens for workers and employers.

4. Expanded Compliance & Transparency Features

By automating wage enforcement, compliance tracking, and governance, PNW guarantees a workforce system built on integrity, security, and efficiency.

5. Integration with Noir & Aleo: Enhanced Privacy & Security

PNW utilizes Noir & Aleo for privacy-preserving compliance and payroll processing, ensuring that sensitive employment data remains secure while still being verifiable.

5.1 Zero-Knowledge Payroll Processing

🔹 Workers receive ZK-signed payroll proofs, allowing verification without revealing private salary details.
🔹 Payroll rollups minimize gas fees, reducing costs for employers and workers.

5.2 Aleo’s Private Smart Contracts for Worker Protection

🔒 Employers cannot modify records once submitted, preventing wage theft and contract fraud.
🔎 Compliance verifications occur on-chain but remain private, ensuring legal and financial confidentiality.

By eliminating third-party intermediaries and relying on Noir & Aleo, PNW ensures secure, verifiable, and trustless workforce management.


## State-Based SubDAOs for Tax & Regulatory Compliance

To streamline payroll tax compliance and regulatory adherence within the U.S., **SubDAOs are initially separated by state**. Each state-based SubDAO will handle worker payroll, tax reporting, and compliance based on its respective state’s labor and taxation requirements.

To facilitate this structure, **ANS subDomains are being created for each state**, such as:

- `wa001_subdao.pnw.ans` (Washington)
- `or001_subdao.pnw.ans` (Oregon)
- `tx001_subdao.pnw.ans` (Texas)  
- …and so on for all 50 states and U.S. territories.

These SubDAOs ensure that tax reporting and payroll execution remain compliant with **state-specific regulations**, while maintaining a decentralized governance structure.

### Future Expansion & County-Level SubDAOs
- Initially, each state will have **one primary SubDAO** (e.g., `wa001_subdao.pnw.ans` for Washington).  
- **If membership capacity reaches a set threshold (e.g., 90% full),** a new SubDAO will be created (e.g., `wa002_subdao.pnw.ans`).  
- Members will be distributed strategically to ensure **no SubDAO is left with too few members.**  
- In the future, if necessary, **county-level SubDAOs** may be introduced for finer tax/regulatory alignment.

This structure allows for **scalable growth**, ensuring **workers, employers, and governance bodies operate within compliant tax and regulatory frameworks** while keeping decentralized oversight intact.

## 🔹 Mining Operations & Proof-of-Work Rewards
The **PNW Mining Pool** enables **farm-owned mining rigs** to participate in Aleo’s **Proof of Succinct Work (PoSW)**, ensuring decentralized mining and fair reward distribution.

### 🔸 PNW Mining Pool Features
✔ **Farm-Owned Mining** – Agricultural farms **operate Aleo miners** to secure the network and generate income.  
✔ **Mining Pool Smart Contract** – Miners **aggregate proofs** for optimized block completion, improving mining speed and efficiency.  
✔ **Fair Reward Distribution** – Mining payouts are allocated as follows:  
   - **40% → Farm Owners**  
   - **30% → Workers (Payroll Bonus)**  
   - **20% → SubDAOs (Governance & Incentives)**  
   - **10% → OversightDAO (Monitoring & Enforcement)**  
✔ **Batch Proof Aggregation** – Multiple farms submit ZK proofs, **reducing redundant work and boosting mining speed**.  
✔ **Worker Mining Rewards** – Workers **receive mining income** alongside their payroll.  

This system ensures **farms benefit from mining operations** while supporting the **PNW ecosystem**.

## 🔹 RWA & Fractional NFT (frNFT) Marketplace Readiness
The **PNW Marketplace** will support **fractional RWA NFTs (frNFTs)** tied to **farm investments & agricultural products**.

### 🔸 How frNFTs Work
✔ **Farm Investment RWA NFTs** – When workers **invest in farm projects**, their **stake is tokenized as an frNFT**.  
✔ **Fractional Ownership** – frNFTs **represent shares** in a farm’s **livestock, crops, or agricultural goods**.  
✔ **Marketplace Redemption** – Workers can **redeem their frNFTs for real-world assets or sell them** in the **PNW Decentralized Farmers Market**.  
✔ **Trustless Exchange** – The marketplace **ensures on-chain verification of all transactions**, **preventing speculation** and **false price inflation**.
