## 1. Introduction  
The **Proven National Workers (PNW) System** is a decentralized workforce and payroll network designed to enhance **labor compliance, financial transparency, and secure employment verification** while **protecting workers and employers** through **on-chain automation, identity verification, and governance mechanisms**.  

PNW does not **replace or override existing government systems** but instead serves as a **digital compliance layer** that ensures employment records, payroll processing, and workforce protections are **recorded, auditable, and enforceable** on-chain. By leveraging automated verification mechanisms, structured wage distribution, and compliance tracking, PNW fosters a **more accountable and efficient labor ecosystem**.

## 2. Purpose & Design Philosophy  

The **PNW Smart Contract System** is structured as a **compliance enhancement tool**, ensuring that workforce operations remain **aligned with legal and financial standards**. It operates with the following key objectives:  

- **Enhancing workforce oversight** through verifiable on-chain employment agreements, payroll records, and tax contributions.  
- **Providing automated verification mechanisms** to validate work eligibility without replacing existing government verification structures.  
- **Ensuring payroll stability** by enforcing pre-funded wages and tax compliance before funds are distributed.  
- **Empowering both workers and employers** through decentralized governance that **maintains workforce integrity while upholding labor agreements**.  

These measures **streamline workforce operations without interfering with established governance structures**.

## 3. Core Functionalities  

The PNW system operates through **automated smart contracts** that **enforce financial and workforce compliance** without reliance on intermediaries. Below is an overview of how each function works:

### 3.1 Identity & Employment Verification  
- Workers provide **on-chain attestations** of employment status.  
- Employers verify worker eligibility using **existing government databases via API requests** (government data remains in **government control**).  
- Once verified, workers receive a **cryptographic proof of employment**, allowing them to access payroll and governance rights.  

**Key Clarification:** *PNW does not modify, replace, or store government workforce data. It only requests API-based verification for eligibility, ensuring all work is legally authorized.*  

### 3.2 Financial Accountability & Payroll Enforcement  
- **Escrowed payroll contracts** require employers to pre-fund wages before work begins.  
- **Automated deductions** ensure tax contributions are allocated at the point of payroll processing.  
- **On-chain audits** prevent manipulation, ensuring every financial transaction is recorded and traceable.  

### 3.3 Workforce Protections & Governance  
- **Workers and employers participate in governance through SubDAOs**, ensuring collective decision-making.  
- **Workers can report workplace violations on-chain**, providing a **secure, immutable complaint process**.  
- **Employer compliance history is tracked**, preventing abusive employment practices and ensuring continuous regulatory adherence.  

### 3.4 Compliance Tracking & Government API Requests  
- Employers submitting payroll must meet **predefined tax compliance thresholds** before payouts occur.  
- API requests are used to **verify tax payments**, **validate business legitimacy**, and **confirm work eligibility**.  
- Government agencies remain **in full control of their own data**, with PNW serving only as a **request-based compliance enforcer**.  

**Key Clarification:** *PNW does not interfere with government employment positions or decision-making processes. It only facilitates structured, automated verification to streamline compliance for workers and employers.*
