# PNW Smart Contract System

## Overview  
The **Proven Non-Citizen Workers (PNW) Smart Contract System** is a decentralized payroll, governance, and compliance platform designed for migrant workers. Built on **Aleo** for privacy-preserving transactions, it ensures fair wages, tax compliance, and decentralized decision-making.

## Features  
- **Payroll Processing**: Employers prepay wages & taxes, with automated payments to workers.  
- **Tax Compliance**: Automatic withholding and remittance of employer taxes to relevant authorities.  
- **SubDAO Governance**: Workers participate in decentralized governance to vote on penalties and expenditures.  
- **Worker Identity**: Optional **ZPass** integration for enhanced verification and benefits.  
- **Cross-Chain Interoperability**: Now supports **Stellar Soroban** as an additional payroll settlement option.  

## Stellar Integration  
- **Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Proofs for Payroll**: Ensures payroll transactions remain private while allowing Stellar verification.  
- **Soroban Smart Contract**: Validates payroll proofs before executing payments on **Stellar**.  
- **Multi-Network Support**: Workers can now choose between **Aleo USDC**, **EVM chains**, and **Stellar USDC** for payroll.
