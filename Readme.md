# **Whitepaper: Proven National Worker (PNW) Smart Contract System**

## **Abstract**

The **Proven National Worker (PNW) Smart Contract System** introduces a decentralized, transparent, and compliant framework to manage employment, payroll, and governance for **Proven National Citizen Workers (PNcW)** and **Proven National Immigrant Workers (PNiW)**. This system ensures a secure, scalable approach to managing migrant labor through blockchain technology, incentivized verification, decentralized governance, and cross-border payroll integration, including **Stellar** and **Aleo** networks.

## **1. Introduction**

The **PNW Smart Contract System** provides a decentralized framework that allows for automated payroll, verifiable worker identities, and compliance with global tax regulations. By integrating the Aleo and Stellar blockchain networks, this system aims to establish a borderless workforce where international workers (PNcW and PNiW) can seamlessly access payroll and investment opportunities. Through SubDAO governance and incentivized participation, the system ensures that the rights of workers are protected while maintaining transparency and fairness in all processes.

## **2. Motivation & Problem Statement**

The global migrant workforce often faces a lack of transparency, security, and fairness in traditional payroll systems. Migrant workers may encounter difficulties in ensuring tax compliance, securing timely wages, and verifying their employment history. Additionally, cross-border employment presents a challenge in reconciling differing regulatory requirements. The PNW system addresses these issues by leveraging blockchain technology to ensure:
- **Timely, verifiable payroll**
- **Automatic tax compliance**
- **Worker rights protection** through decentralized governance (SubDAOs)
- **Cross-border payroll integration** through Aleo and Stellar

## **3. System Overview**

The **PNW Smart Contract System** is built on Aleo's **zero-knowledge (ZK) technology** for privacy-preserving payroll management and governance. The system is structured into two key components:
1. **Proven National Citizen Workers (PNcW)**: Workers holding a nationality from the country they work in.
2. **Proven National Immigrant Workers (PNiW)**: Workers who are non-citizens but legally employed through migrant work visas.

These workers' identities, payrolls, and governance rights are managed on-chain, using smart contracts, to provide transparency and security. Payments are processed using **Aleo’s native USDC** for domestic payroll or **bridged USDC** for international workers, with **Stellar** integration enabling cross-border payouts.

## **4. Technology Stack**

### Blockchain Architecture
The system uses Aleo's **zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs** to enable private and efficient transaction processing. Aleo’s secure execution environment ensures that worker data is only accessible to authorized parties.

### Aleo Integration
Aleo’s **privacy-preserving infrastructure** provides a foundation for managing sensitive worker data while ensuring compliance. **Aleo-native USDC** is used for local payments, and **ZK-proofs** validate worker payroll records.

### Stellar Integration
The Stellar network, used for **cross-border payroll**, ensures global interoperability. The **Soroban smart contract layer** on Stellar will verify **ZK-proofs** generated by Aleo, ensuring the validity of payroll data and compliance with tax regulations.

## **5. Components & Smart Contracts**

### Worker Identity Verification
The **Worker Identity Smart Contract** ensures that workers’ identities are verified on-chain, allowing for reliable payroll processing. The integration with **ZPass** enables faster processing for ZPass-verified workers, who also benefit from higher trust fund contributions.

### Payroll System
The **Payroll Smart Contract** handles payroll distribution, based on agreed wages, ensuring **compliance with local and international tax regulations**. Employers are required to prepay **wages and taxes** to ensure funds are available for timely payouts.

### Governance & SubDAOs
**SubDAOs** are responsible for **voting on key decisions** within the system, such as:
- Employer penalties for non-compliance
- Farm investment payouts
- Distribution of community funds
Each worker holds one vote within their SubDAO, ensuring decentralized and democratic decision-making.

### Farm Investments & Payouts
The **Farm Investment Smart Contract** tracks investments made into worker cooperatives or farms. Payouts are made monthly, with **Merkle proofs** validating payouts, ensuring transparency and accountability. SubDAOs can vote on payout approval, delays, or denials based on network conditions.

### ZPass Verification
ZPass allows workers to **prove their identity** securely, using **zero-knowledge proofs** to avoid exposing sensitive information. ZPass-verified workers benefit from faster payroll processing and higher trust fund contributions.

## **6. Security & Compliance**

### Tax Compliance & Payroll Governance
Automated payroll compliance is managed through smart contracts that handle:
- **Employer tax payments**
- **Automated tax payments to governments** based on SubDAO approval
The system ensures that only compliant employers can hire workers, with penalties for non-compliance.

### ZK-Proof Mechanism for Stellar Integration
Payroll data is verified using **ZK-proofs**, which ensure that only valid employment records are processed by **Stellar’s Soroban contract**. This enables seamless cross-border payments while maintaining **privacy and security**.

### Cross-border Employment Compliance
The integration with Stellar allows for **global payroll processing**, ensuring that international workers’ earnings are tracked, compliant, and paid in a timely manner.

## **7. Incentives**

### Worker Benefits
Workers benefit from:
- **Higher trust fund contributions** if verified with ZPass
- **Priority payroll processing**
- **Increased worker protection** through SubDAO governance

### Employer Incentives
Employers who comply with tax regulations and provide timely wages will benefit from:
- **Lower fees** for payroll processing
- **Access to a reliable, compliant workforce**

### SubDAO Governance Incentives
SubDAOs have the authority to govern the **distribution of funds**, make decisions about **investment payouts**, and **penalize non-compliant employers**.

## **8. Conclusion**

The **PNW Smart Contract System** enables a **transparent, secure, and compliant framework** for managing workers in the **global labor market**. Through decentralized governance and blockchain technology, workers can access reliable payroll and benefits, while employers are incentivized to comply with tax and regulatory standards. Stellar integration enhances the global scope of this solution, enabling cross-border employment with ease and compliance.

## **9. Future Work & Roadmap**

- **Q2 2025**: Full integration of **ZPass verification** for faster payroll processing.
- **Q3 2025**: Expansion to additional countries and regulatory compliance updates.
- **Q4 2025**: **Automated dispute resolution** system and further integration with **government APIs** for employment verification.
- **2026**: Expand the system to include additional **payment networks** and **regional SubDAOs** for better scalability.
