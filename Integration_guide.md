# PNW Smart Contract: Stellar Integration Guide  

## Overview  
This guide explains how to integrate Stellar as an optional payroll processing network within the PNW ecosystem. It outlines the steps for executing payroll transactions on Stellar, verifying payments using zero-knowledge proofs, and ensuring compliance with PNW governance.

## 1. **System Requirements**  

### **1.1. Software Dependencies**  
Before integrating Stellar, ensure you have the following installed:  

- **Rust** (Latest stable version)  
- **Cargo** (Rust package manager)  
- **Aleo CLI** (For zk-proof generation)  
- **Soroban CLI** (For deploying & interacting with Stellar smart contracts)  
- **Node.js** (For deployment scripts)  
- **Docker** (Optional, for containerized Stellar nodes)

## 2. **Stellar Integration Components**  

### **2.1. ZK Payroll Verification**  
The **zk_verifier.leo** contract generates a proof that verifies:  
1. The worker's identity and payroll record.  
2. The employer's compliance with tax requirements.  
3. The payroll amount matches the agreed-upon sum.  

### **2.2. Stellar Smart Contract (Soroban)**  
The **stellar_verifier.rs** contract on Soroban:  
1. Accepts a zk-proof from Aleo confirming a valid payroll transaction.  
2. Releases the payroll amount to the worker's Stellar wallet.  
3. Logs the transaction for compliance tracking.

## 3. **Deployment Process**  

### **3.1. Deploy the Aleo ZK Verifier**  
Run the following command to deploy the Aleo-based payroll proof system:  

```sh
aleo deploy zk_verifier.leo
