# Overview of PNW Smart Contract System

## Introduction  
The **Proven Non-Citizen Workers (PNW) Smart Contract System** is a decentralized, privacy-focused payroll and governance system designed to support migrant workers. Built on **Aleo**, it leverages **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)** to protect worker privacy while ensuring employer compliance and fair wages.

## Key Components  
- **Payroll System**: Automates wage payments, tracks tax compliance, and enables multi-network payouts.  
- **SubDAO Governance**: Worker-led decentralized governance structure for handling employer disputes, payroll policies, and penalties.  
- **Tax Compliance**: Ensures automatic tax remittance via integrated government APIs.  
- **Worker Identity**: Provides optional **ZPass** verification for enhanced trust and benefits.  
- **Cross-Chain Interoperability**: Supports **Aleo USDC**, **EVM chains**, and now **Stellar USDC** for payroll.

## Stellar Integration  
With the addition of **Stellar Soroban**, PNW expands its interoperability, providing an additional option for payroll settlement:  
- **ZK Payroll Proofs**: Aleo generates cryptographic proofs that Stellar verifies before processing payments.  
- **Soroban Smart Contracts**: Execute payroll transactions securely on the **Stellar** network.  
- **Expanded Payment Options**: Workers can now select between Aleo, EVM, or Stellar for their payouts.

## Security & Compliance  
- **Privacy-Preserving Payroll**: Uses Aleo's zero-knowledge technology to protect salary data.  
- **Tax Enforcement**: Automated compliance ensures that employer contributions are properly collected.  
- **Worker Protections**: SubDAOs monitor employer conduct, with governance mechanisms for disputes.  

## Future Expansions  
- **More Cross-Chain Integrations**: Additional blockchain networks for payroll flexibility.  
- **Enhanced ZK Verification**: Further optimizations for seamless compliance across jurisdictions.  
- **Expanded Worker Benefits**: More governance tools to empower workers in decision-making.  

## Conclusion  
The **PNW Smart Contract System** is designed to create a **secure, decentralized, and fair** payroll solution for migrant workers. With **multi-chain support**, **automated compliance**, and **privacy-first architecture**, it offers a robust alternative to traditional payroll systems.
