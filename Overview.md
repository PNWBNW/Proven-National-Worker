PNW ensures that **worker wages are processed securely**, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive salary data.  
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**: Payroll transactions remain confidential while proving compliance.  
- **Multi-Chain Payroll Options**: Workers can receive payments on **Aleo, EVM chains, or Stellar**.  
- **Gas Fee Allocation**:  
  - **Aleo USDC Payroll**: **Gas fees covered by SubDAOs**.  
  - **EVM Payroll**: **Workers choose between direct settlement (faster) or rollups (cheaper)**.  
  - **Stellar Payroll**: **ZK verification before processing payments**.  

### **2. SubDAO Governance & Decentralized Worker Rights Protection**  
Workers are **empowered through decentralized governance** to ensure fair treatment and accountability.  
- **Worker-Led SubDAOs**: Each worker is part of a **SubDAO** that votes on governance decisions.  
- **Employer Penalties**: Employers who violate wage laws or fail compliance **can be penalized or blacklisted**.  
- **Payroll Dispute Resolution**: Workers can **report abusive employers**, with **SubDAOs voting on penalties**.  
- **Votable Worker Benefits**: **SubDAO funds** can be allocated to **worker benefits** via governance votes.

### **4. Optional ZPass Worker Identity Verification**  
Workers can choose to **verify their identity through ZPass** for additional benefits.  
- **Increased Trust Fund Contributions**: ZPass-verified workers receive **+0.5% APY on unpaid wages**.  
- **Priority Payroll Processing**: Verified workers get **faster transaction settlements**.  
- **Privacy-Preserving Authentication**: ZPass uses **zero-knowledge proofs**, ensuring **identity privacy**.  

### **5. Cross-Chain Payroll with Stellar Integration**
