PNW Software Proprietary License Addendum

Aztec Network Adaptation & Expansion Clause

Effective Date: [Feb. 12. 2025]

Owner: Joshua D. Day

Scope: This addendum applies to all adaptations, duplications, and modifications of the PNW smart contract suite designed for use on the Aztec Network, Ethereum Layer 2 solutions, or Noir-based platforms.


---

1. Ownership & Restrictions

1.1 Exclusive Rights

All original smart contract logic, governance mechanisms, payroll structures, trust fund models, and SubDAO implementations are the exclusive intellectual property of the PNW project and Joshua D. Day.

The adaptation of these mechanisms for Aztec’s Noir framework, Ethereum Layer 2 environments, or related ZK-based rollups remains protected under this proprietary license.


1.2 Prohibited Actions

No entity, developer, or organization may copy, modify, deploy, or utilize the Aztec-adapted version of PNW without explicit written permission from the owner.

Porting the PNW contracts to other ZK environments (e.g., StarkNet, Polygon zkEVM, or Mina) without authorization constitutes a license violation.


1.3 No Preemptive Deployments

Any attempt to deploy, publish, or commercially distribute a version of PNW on Aztec or a similar platform before the official PNW launch will be considered a breach of this license.



---

2. Derivative Works & Integration Rules

2.1 No Unauthorized Forks

Forking or modifying the PNW Aztec-adapted contracts without an approved Contributor License Agreement (CLA) is strictly prohibited.

Integration with third-party rollups, sidechains, or private ZK ecosystems must be formally approved in writing by the owner.


2.2 Authorized Implementations

Only approved collaborators and contributors may work on PNW’s Aztec version.

Any attempted commercial adaptation must undergo a formal review before deployment.



---

3. Legal Enforcement & Recourse

3.1 Enforcement Actions

Any unauthorized use, deployment, or modification of the PNW Aztec-based software will result in legal action and takedown requests.

The owner reserves the right to issue DMCA takedowns or similar copyright protections on repositories violating this license.


3.2 Governing Law & Jurisdiction

This addendum is governed under [Douglas County Washington] law.

Any disputes shall be resolved through arbitration or legal proceedings under the specified jurisdiction.
