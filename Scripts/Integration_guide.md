# PNW Smart Contract Integration Guide

## Overview
This guide provides instructions on how to integrate the PNW smart contract system with external services, including employer payroll systems, government tax APIs, and worker identity verification tools.

---

## 1. Smart Contract Structure
The PNW smart contract consists of the following core modules:

- **`payroll.leo`** – Handles worker payments and tax deductions.
- **`worker_identity.leo`** – Manages worker identity verification.
- **`compliance_tracking.leo`** – Tracks employer compliance with tax and wage laws.
- **`subdao_management.leo`** – Ensures proper governance and tax payments by SubDAOs.
- **`government_api.leo`** – Interfaces with government agencies for tax verification.

---

## 2. Employer Payroll Integration
### Steps:
1. Employers must **preload funds** into the PNW contract before processing payroll.
2. Employers initiate payroll using `batch_process_payroll.leo`, which automates worker payments and tax deductions.
3. The system verifies tax compliance using `process_tax_compliance.leo` before transferring funds.

### API Calls:
- `process_payroll()` – Pays wages and deducts taxes.
- `verify_compliance()` – Confirms employer adherence to tax laws.

---

## 3. Government API Integration
Government agencies can verify tax payments and employer compliance via `government_api.leo`.

### API Functions:
- `verify_employer_compliance()` – Checks employer tax history.
- `request_tax_records()` – Retrieves payroll tax payments for audits.

---

## 4. Worker Identity Verification
Workers can verify their identity using `worker_identity.leo`. Optional integration with **ZPass** enables Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) authentication.

### Verification Options:
- **Standard PNW identity verification** (on-chain NFT identity).
- **ZPass authentication** (optional, for increased trust and payroll benefits).

---

## 5. SubDAO Governance & Compliance
SubDAOs handle employer compliance and worker governance. They can:
- Vote on employer penalties.
- Manage worker wage negotiations.
- Approve employer reinstatement after non-compliance fines.

---

## 6. Security & Compliance Best Practices
- Always verify employer tax payments before processing payroll.
- Use **encrypted government API calls** for secure tax reporting.
- Ensure workers’ private data remains confidential through **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs).**

---

## Next Steps
- **Employers:** Integrate payroll calls into HR systems.
- **Governments:** Use API endpoints for tax compliance audits.
- **Workers:** Verify identity through ZPass or PNW identity NFT.
