## ðŸ“Œ Technical Architecture  

The **PNW System** leverages **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK)** and **cross-chain payroll processing** to ensure **decentralized and auditable employment practices**.  

### **ðŸ”¹ Smart Contract Integrations**  
| Component        | Network   | Smart Contract |
|-----------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Worker Identity** | Stellar | `worker_identity.rs` |
| **Payroll Processing** | EVM | `pncw_payroll.sol`, `pniw_payroll.sol` |
| **Employer Compliance** | EVM | `employer_contract.sol` |
| **Trust Pool Management** | EVM | `pncw_trust_pool.sol`, `pniw_trust_pool.sol` |
| **Cross-Chain Payroll** | Stellar â†” Aleo | `stellar_integration.rs`, `zk_payroll.rs` |
