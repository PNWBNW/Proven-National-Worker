## State-Based SubDAOs for Tax & Regulatory Compliance

To streamline payroll tax compliance and regulatory adherence within the U.S., **SubDAOs are initially separated by state**. Each state-based SubDAO will handle worker payroll, tax reporting, and compliance based on its respective state’s labor and taxation requirements.

To facilitate this structure, **ANS subDomains are being created for each state**, such as:

- `wa001_subdao.pnw.ans` (Washington)
- `or001_subdao.pnw.ans` (Oregon)
- `tx001_subdao.pnw.ans` (Texas)  
- …and so on for all 50 states and U.S. territories.

These SubDAOs ensure that tax reporting and payroll execution remain compliant with **state-specific regulations**, while maintaining a decentralized governance structure.

### Future Expansion & County-Level SubDAOs
- Initially, each state will have **one primary SubDAO** (e.g., `wa001_subdao.pnw.ans` for Washington).  
- **If membership capacity reaches a set threshold (e.g., 90% full),** a new SubDAO will be created (e.g., `wa002_subdao.pnw.ans`).  
- Members will be distributed strategically to ensure **no SubDAO is left with too few members.**  
- In the future, if necessary, **county-level SubDAOs** may be introduced for finer tax/regulatory alignment.

This structure allows for **scalable growth**, ensuring **workers, employers, and governance bodies operate within compliant tax and regulatory frameworks** while keeping decentralized oversight intact.

## 🔹 Mining Operations & Proof-of-Work Rewards
The **PNW Mining Pool** enables **farm-owned mining rigs** to participate in Aleo’s **Proof of Succinct Work (PoSW)**, ensuring decentralized mining and fair reward distribution.

### 🔸 PNW Mining Pool Features
✔ **Farm-Owned Mining** – Agricultural farms **operate Aleo miners** to secure the network and generate income.  
✔ **Mining Pool Smart Contract** – Miners **aggregate proofs** for optimized block completion, improving mining speed and efficiency.  
✔ **Fair Reward Distribution** – Mining payouts are allocated as follows:  
   - **40% → Farm Owners**  
   - **30% → Workers (Payroll Bonus)**  
   - **20% → SubDAOs (Governance & Incentives)**  
   - **10% → OversightDAO (Monitoring & Enforcement)**  
✔ **Batch Proof Aggregation** – Multiple farms submit ZK proofs, **reducing redundant work and boosting mining speed**.  
✔ **Worker Mining Rewards** – Workers **receive mining income** alongside their payroll.  

This system ensures **farms benefit from mining operations** while supporting the **PNW ecosystem**.

## 🔹 RWA & Fractional NFT (frNFT) Marketplace Readiness
The **PNW Marketplace** will support **fractional RWA NFTs (frNFTs)** tied to **farm investments & agricultural products**.

### 🔸 How frNFTs Work
✔ **Farm Investment RWA NFTs** – When workers **invest in farm projects**, their **stake is tokenized as an frNFT**.  
✔ **Fractional Ownership** – frNFTs **represent shares** in a farm’s **livestock, crops, or agricultural goods**.  
✔ **Marketplace Redemption** – Workers can **redeem their frNFTs for real-world assets or sell them** in the **PNW Decentralized Farmers Market**.  
✔ **Trustless Exchange** – The marketplace **ensures on-chain verification of all transactions**, **preventing speculation** and **false price inflation**.
