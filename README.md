# PNW System - Decentralized Workforce, Payroll, and Farm Investment

Proven National Workers (PNW) – A Decentralized Workforce Solution

Story & Vision

In a world where workers often face uncertainty, delayed payments, and exploitative conditions, Proven National Workers (PNW) was created to restore fairness, transparency, and financial security to the workforce. Built on decentralized systems and zero-knowledge privacy protections, PNW ensures that every worker is paid fairly, employers remain accountable, and communities thrive through cooperative governance.

At its core, PNW is a union-style decentralized workforce network that empowers Proven National Citizen Workers (PNcW) and Proven National Immigrant Workers (PNiW) to manage payroll, employment agreements, and worker investments—all on-chain. Workers own their financial future, participating in decentralized labor agreements, farm investment co-ops, and trust funds that are safeguarded against manipulation.

By integrating state-based SubDAOs, on-chain payroll enforcement, and compliance tracking, PNW ensures timely wages, tax transparency, and employer accountability. The system is designed to adapt to real-world labor markets, protecting migrant workers, independent contractors, and cooperative laborers from financial instability.

Our vision is simple: A decentralized, worker-driven economy where labor is protected, investments are fair, and every contribution is rewarded transparently.

What is PNW?

PNW is a multi-chain, privacy-focused labor management system that enables:

Automated Payroll Processing – Secure and enforceable wage payments with compliance tracking.

Worker-Governed SubDAOs – Localized labor unions managing payroll, employer oversight, and governance.

On-Chain Farm Investments – Workers invest directly in sustainable agriculture, mining, and trade, earning real-world returns.

Decentralized Compliance Tracking – Employer tax payments, work history, and certifications are enforced on-chain.

Trust Fund Protection – Workers can store earnings for their families, with transparent governance on withdrawals.

Cross-Chain Interoperability – Payroll and investments bridge between Aleo, Stellar, Aztec, and EVM chains for scalability.


By blending decentralized governance, privacy-preserving payroll enforcement, and cooperative economics, PNW ensures that workers, not corporations or intermediaries, hold the power over their financial future.

Why PNW?

Because workers deserve better. Because migrant labor should be protected. Because payroll should be fair, instant, and transparent.

With PNW, we build the future of decentralized labor—one paycheck at a time.
