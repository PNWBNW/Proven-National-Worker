# PNW System - Decentralized Workforce, Payroll, and Farm Investment

Proven National Workers (PNW) – A Decentralized Workforce Solution

Story & Vision

In a world where workers often face uncertainty, delayed payments, and exploitative conditions, Proven National Workers (PNW) was created to restore fairness, transparency, and financial security to the workforce. Built on decentralized systems and zero-knowledge privacy protections, PNW ensures that every worker is paid fairly, employers remain accountable, and communities thrive through cooperative governance.

At its core, PNW is a union-style decentralized workforce network that empowers Proven National Citizen Workers (PNcW) and Proven National Immigrant Workers (PNiW) to manage payroll, employment agreements, and worker investments—all on-chain. Workers own their financial future, participating in decentralized labor agreements, farm investment co-ops, and trust funds that are safeguarded against manipulation.

By integrating state-based SubDAOs, on-chain payroll enforcement, and compliance tracking, PNW ensures timely wages, tax transparency, and employer accountability. The system is designed to adapt to real-world labor markets, protecting migrant workers, independent contractors, and cooperative laborers from financial instability.

Our vision is simple: A decentralized, worker-driven economy where labor is protected, investments are fair, and every contribution is rewarded transparently.

What is PNW?

PNW is a multi-chain, privacy-focused labor management system that enables:

Automated Payroll Processing – Secure and enforceable wage payments with compliance tracking.

Worker-Governed SubDAOs – Localized labor unions managing payroll, employer oversight, and governance.

On-Chain Farm Investments – Workers invest directly in sustainable agriculture, mining, and trade, earning real-world returns.

Decentralized Compliance Tracking – Employer tax payments, work history, and certifications are enforced on-chain.

Trust Fund Protection – Workers can store earnings for their families, with transparent governance on withdrawals.

Cross-Chain Interoperability – Payroll and investments bridge between Aleo, Stellar, Aztec, and EVM chains for scalability.


By blending decentralized governance, privacy-preserving payroll enforcement, and cooperative economics, PNW ensures that workers, not corporations or intermediaries, hold the power over their financial future.

Why PNW?

Because workers deserve better. Because migrant labor should be protected. Because payroll should be fair, instant, and transparent.

With PNW, we build the future of decentralized labor—one paycheck at a time.

## State-Based SubDAOs for Tax & Regulatory Compliance

To streamline payroll tax compliance and regulatory adherence within the U.S., **SubDAOs are initially separated by state**. Each state-based SubDAO will handle worker payroll, tax reporting, and compliance based on its respective state’s labor and taxation requirements.

To facilitate this structure, **ANS subDomains are being created for each state**, such as:

- `wa001_subdao.pnw.ans` (Washington)
- `or001_subdao.pnw.ans` (Oregon)
- `tx001_subdao.pnw.ans` (Texas)  
- …and so on for all 50 states and U.S. territories.

These SubDAOs ensure that tax reporting and payroll execution remain compliant with **state-specific regulations**, while maintaining a decentralized governance structure.

### Future Expansion & County-Level SubDAOs
- Initially, each state will have **one primary SubDAO** (e.g., `wa001_subdao.pnw.ans` for Washington).  
- **If membership capacity reaches a set threshold (e.g., 90% full),** a new SubDAO will be created (e.g., `wa002_subdao.pnw.ans`).  
- Members will be distributed strategically to ensure **no SubDAO is left with too few members.**  
- In the future, if necessary, **county-level SubDAOs** may be introduced for finer tax/regulatory alignment.

This structure allows for **scalable growth**, ensuring **workers, employers, and governance bodies operate within compliant tax and regulatory frameworks** while keeping decentralized oversight intact.

## 🔹 Mining Operations & Proof-of-Work Rewards
The **PNW Mining Pool** enables **farm-owned mining rigs** to participate in Aleo’s **Proof of Succinct Work (PoSW)**, ensuring decentralized mining and fair reward distribution.

### 🔸 PNW Mining Pool Features
✔ **Farm-Owned Mining** – Agricultural farms **operate Aleo miners** to secure the network and generate income.  
✔ **Mining Pool Smart Contract** – Miners **aggregate proofs** for optimized block completion, improving mining speed and efficiency.  
✔ **Fair Reward Distribution** – Mining payouts are allocated as follows:  
   - **40% → Farm Owners**  
   - **30% → Workers (Payroll Bonus)**  
   - **20% → SubDAOs (Governance & Incentives)**  
   - **10% → OversightDAO (Monitoring & Enforcement)**  
✔ **Batch Proof Aggregation** – Multiple farms submit ZK proofs, **reducing redundant work and boosting mining speed**.  
✔ **Worker Mining Rewards** – Workers **receive mining income** alongside their payroll.  

This system ensures **farms benefit from mining operations** while supporting the **PNW ecosystem**.

## 🔹 RWA & Fractional NFT (frNFT) Marketplace Readiness
The **PNW Marketplace** will support **fractional RWA NFTs (frNFTs)** tied to **farm investments & agricultural products**.

### 🔸 How frNFTs Work
✔ **Farm Investment RWA NFTs** – When workers **invest in farm projects**, their **stake is tokenized as an frNFT**.  
✔ **Fractional Ownership** – frNFTs **represent shares** in a farm’s **livestock, crops, or agricultural goods**.  
✔ **Marketplace Redemption** – Workers can **redeem their frNFTs for real-world assets or sell them** in the **PNW Decentralized Farmers Market**.  
✔ **Trustless Exchange** – The marketplace **ensures on-chain verification of all transactions**, **preventing speculation** and **false price inflation**.
