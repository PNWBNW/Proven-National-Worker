# 🚀 Proven National Workers (PNW) System  

The **PNW System** is a decentralized smart contract suite designed to provide **trustless payroll, PTO/Sick Pay management, farm investment tracking, and regulatory compliance** across **Aleo, Stellar Soroban, and EVM-based chains**.

---

## 📌 Features  

✅ **On-Chain Payroll** – Supports **PNcW (Citizen) and PNiW (Immigrant) workers** with **real-time employer compliance tracking**.  
✅ **PTO & Sick Pay** – Workers accrue **PTO & Sick Pay** via payroll, with **direct withdrawals & farm investment options**.  
✅ **Farm Investment Contracts** – Agricultural workers can **invest PTO/Sick Pay into farm projects** and **mint RWA NFTs**.  
✅ **Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Verification** – Uses **ZPass & Merkle proofs** to validate **worker identity & tax compliance**.  
✅ **Aleo Naming Service (ANS) Integration** – Workers can **link their identity to human-readable ANS names**.  
✅ **Multi-Chain Bridging** – Payroll can **settle via Aleo, Stellar, or EVM rollups** to minimize gas fees.  
✅ **Regulatory Compliance** – Employer taxes are **automatically verified via government API integration**.  
✅ **SubDAO Governance** – Workers **vote on investment choices**, and **DAOs enforce compliance penalties**.
