# Proven National Workers (PNW) System Whitepaper  

## **Abstract**  
The **Proven National Workers (PNW) System** is a **decentralized payroll and compliance framework** designed to ensure **fair, transparent, and auditable** employment processes for **Proven National Citizen Workers (PNcW)** and **Proven National Immigrant Workers (PNiW)**.  
By integrating **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK), decentralized governance, and cross-chain interoperability (Aleo, Stellar, and EVM),** the PNW System provides a **trustless employment solution** that prioritizes **worker rights, payroll automation, and tax compliance**.

## **1️⃣ Introduction**  

### **1.1 Background**  
Traditional payroll systems rely on **centralized intermediaries** that introduce **high transaction costs, delays, and compliance inefficiencies**. The **PNW System** leverages **blockchain technology, smart contracts, and ZK-proof identity verification** to create a **transparent and decentralized employment ecosystem**.

### **1.2 Core Goals**  
✔ **Automated Payroll Execution** – Smart contracts enforce **on-time payments**.  
✔ **Employer Compliance Tracking** – Employers must **meet tax and payroll obligations** before processing payroll.  
✔ **Decentralized Worker Trust Pools** – Workers’ **earnings are locked for their children until KYC verification (at age 18)**.  
✔ **Cross-Chain Payroll Processing** – Payments are **settled across Aleo, Stellar, and EVM networks**.  
✔ **Privacy-Preserving Identity Verification** – **ZK-Proofs ensure employment legitimacy** without revealing personal details.

## **2️⃣ Technical Architecture**  

The **PNW System** integrates multiple blockchain networks for **scalability, security, and compliance enforcement**.

### **2.1 Smart Contract Integrations**  
| Component              | Network       | Smart Contract            |
|------------------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| **Worker Identity**    | Stellar      | `worker_identity.rs`      |
| **Payroll Processing** | EVM          | `pncw_payroll.sol`, `pniw_payroll.sol` |
| **Employer Compliance** | EVM          | `employer_contract.sol`   |
| **Trust Pool Management** | EVM        | `pncw_trust_pool.sol`, `pniw_trust_pool.sol` |
| **Cross-Chain Payroll** | Aleo ↔ Stellar | `stellar_integration.rs`, `zk_payroll.rs` |

## **3️⃣ Governance & Compliance**  

The **PNW System** is governed by **Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)** that oversee:  
✔ **Employer Compliance Verification** – Employers must maintain **on-chain payroll & tax records**.  
✔ **SubDAO Voting** – SubDAOs **vote on penalties & compliance enforcement actions**.  
✔ **Worker Fund Allocation** – Workers vote on **community-driven trust fund allocations**.  
✔ **Blacklist Mechanism** – Employers failing **3+ tax payments** face **on-chain blacklisting**.

## **4️⃣ Payroll Processing & Staking Model**  

### **4.1 Payroll Mechanism**  
- **Payroll Gas Fees** – SubDAOs **cover gas fees** for on-chain payments, while **workers pay bridging fees for sidechain transfers**.  
- **Employer Prefunding** – Employers must **pre-fund payroll deposits & tax obligations** before payroll execution.  
- **Rollup-Based Batch Processing** – Payroll transactions are **aggregated into rollups** to **reduce gas costs**.  

### **4.2 Staking & Trust Pool**  
- **Trust Fund Locking** – Worker earnings are **locked into trust pools** until **child KYC verification at 18**.  
- **Partial Withdrawals** – Workers can **withdraw funds before 18 with approval from three other workers**.  
- **Employer-Funded Staking Rewards** – Initially **employer-funded**, later sustained by **worker staking fees (1% ZPass, 2% non-ZPass)**.

## **5️⃣ Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK) Implementation**  

The **PNW System** employs **ZK-Proofs** for:  
✔ **Worker Identity Verification** – Workers prove employment **without revealing personal data**.  
✔ **Payroll Compliance Tracking** – Employers submit **ZK-Proofs of tax & payroll compliance**.  
✔ **Trust Pool Redemption** – Children redeem funds **via ZK-based KYC validation**.
